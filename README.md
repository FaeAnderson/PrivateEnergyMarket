# Private Energy Market

A decentralized application for anonymous energy trading using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling secure and private energy transactions on the blockchain.

## üåü Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Contracts
The platform leverages cutting-edge FHE technology powered by Zama to ensure complete privacy in energy transactions. This allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing sensitive information such as energy quantities, prices, or user identities.

### Anonymous Energy Trading
Users can create encrypted energy offers and demands without exposing their trading patterns or preferences. The system maintains market functionality while preserving participant privacy through advanced cryptographic techniques.

### Privacy Energy Market
A revolutionary approach to energy trading where market participants can:
- Trade energy anonymously
- Keep transaction details private
- Maintain competitive advantages
- Comply with privacy regulations
- Execute secure peer-to-peer energy exchanges
